Sami Frank: fran0942, Orion Grebe grebe013

Compile:
- use Makefile included; simply type make.

Sami's contributions:
- part of consumer.c: counting of letters functionality, histogram, completed consumer functionality
- part of producer.c
- part of main.c
- log.txt implementation

Orion's contributions:
- part of consumer.c: began coding initial mutex unlocks + signalling
- part of producer.c: getting data from file > queue
- part of main.c: arguement checking , creating producers and consumers
- header.h
- utils.c: created queue and node structure

Assumptions
- delete log.txt and result.txt after every run to ensure fresh data
-log.txt doesnt produce the correct consumer number (just 0-(linenum-1)). its a known problem that both of us couldn't figure out.
-with larger text files give it a while to finish running.


What the Program does:
- given a .txt file and a cmd line arg for number of consumers, create n consumers to divide up the work of counting the first letter in each word of the .txt file. put the result into a result.txt file and given the -p argument create a log.txt
